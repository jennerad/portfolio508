            <!-- <h1>about me</h1> -->
            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>I am a designer, photographer, photo editor, and maker with over 15 years of experience in visuals, media, and publishing. My lifeâ€™s work sits at the intersection of communication, problem solving and creativity. I have had several careers in both technology and visuals and bring this broad range of experiences and skills with me to each new project.</p>
            <p>I was born in Vermont and raised in Wisconsin and Bellingham, Washington, but I've lived in Seattle longest.</p>
            <p>Most recently I worked as a photo editor for MSN for about two and a half years and before that I was at the Seattle Times for many many years in several different jobs. </p>
            <p>I love to travel and check out art wherever I go. I keep going back to Italy for the architecture and art...not to mention the food and wine! I come from a family of DIY'ers, so I'm usually in the middle of making something or other that I would probably be better off buying.</p>
            <p>I'm a sucker for great storytelling, which is what drew me to photography and photojournalism. But this love of the story also translates to listening to NPR or podcasts, reading , or the occasional Netflix binge. Or just getting lost trying to read every single interesting thing on the internet.
